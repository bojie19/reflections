How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows me the differences between files. The differences between the files can't be much unless the files are messed up completely. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
		- It gives a logical meaning to the work you are doing
	Cons
		- Data loss may happen,  in case of accidental power off for instance

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git commits multiple files in one commit because the files are related to one another somehow:
		- They all make up a single version of a pgm
		- The functionality of one file depends on the others
		

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to see all the commits performed / user created commits
	git diff - to see what has changed between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me confident because it is reversible.
